# Get Started

## Installation

Use npm or yarn to install the package in your project with one of the following commands:

```bash
yarn add ios-theme-toolkit
```
```bash
npm install ios-theme-toolkit --save
```

## How to use

Once installed, you can import this package anywhere in your project that is accessible to the webpack or rollup:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button } from 'ios-theme-toolkit'

export default () => (
  <Button>Click me<Button>
)
```

You will also need to import the styles from this package and you can do it in two ways:

**Using a link tag in HTML:**

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/ios-theme-toolkit/dist/styles.min.css" />
```

**Or importing the css file into the global component of the project. (Make sure your bundler supports this file type.)**

```js
import 'ios-theme-toolkit/dist/styles.min.css';
```

In the side panel you can see a list of all the components available for you to use in your project.
